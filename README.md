# oss_bop_bzst_csv
Jupyter notebook to create the csv file to upload transactions into the BOP portal of the German Federal Central Tax Office (BZSt) in order to create the EU OSS declaration.

Please note that this is just a quick and dirty solution. There are some verifications included in the notebook. However, when using it, you should always double check the OSS declaration with the original source data, if the csv file is accepted by the BOP portal. Also, please note that there are no verification methods of the vat rates and VAT ids included. 

In order to upload the file with the raw in the notebook, use the excel template 'input_template.xlsx'.
